Name = "Starship Pilot"
Description = "You flew a starship – civilian, corporate, military or otherwise. You may have piloted a freighter, a fighter, a shuttle, or a larger ship. <i>Did you have a regular run, or did you fly anywhere? Were you a member of a crew, or did you have one of your own? What kind of flying did you do and what eventually happened to your ship? Did you stick to low and mid-orbit shuttle runs?</i><br>Being a pilot is as much a lifestyle as it is a profession: <i>What was your callsign, and were you known or obscure? Was there a rival service, pilot, or group of pilots that you had friction with? Have you worked with NHPs or flown in combat? Have you ever seen anything strange out in interstellar space or the total void of blinkspace?</i>"

Description = "At the end of the day, empire only functions when labor clocks in. Labor mines the raw materials; labor fashions stone and metal and organic matter into bolts and screws and glue; labor designs the patterns for printers; labor shapes and welds, hammers and builds. Without the labor of trillions, all progress would grind to a halt. <i>Before you set down the wrench and picked up a helm, what kind of work did you do? Did you work in the fields, factories, shipyards, mines, or somewhere else? What was your life like before you began training as a pilot? Why did you leave? Will you return? Was there a project you worked on that you're especially proud of? Do you have an old crew still working on the clock? What world did you call home, and what were the working conditions there?</i>"
